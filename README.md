# Valerie's "Pop the Balloon" Game
Let's relax with a little game. :smiley:

The goal of this project is to create a simple game where balloons change color and display "POP!" when hovered over. When 25 balloons have been "popped," it triggers a message saying "all popped!" and clears the balloon gallery.

## HTML Structure
The HTML code sets up the web page for my "Pop the Balloon" game. It includes standard HTML5 document structure with a DOCTYPE declaration and definitions of the root elements: `html`, `head`, and `body`.  
 - **Metadata:** The `head` section includes metadata such as character set, viewport settings for responsiveness, and compatibility mode.
 - **Stylesheet Link:** This code links an external CSS file for styling.
 - **Scripts:** This code links an external JavaScript file
    - **Inline JavaScript:** This code contains a script that dynamically generates balloons inside the `balloon-gallery` div.

## CSS Styling
I have set up the CSS code for my "Pop the Balloon" game so that the user sees a few rows of circles (balloons) of different colors. 

## JavaScript Functionality
